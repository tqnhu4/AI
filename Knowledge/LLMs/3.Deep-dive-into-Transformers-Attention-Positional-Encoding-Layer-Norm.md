## Part 1: Theory with Examples 📚

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the key components of a Transformer, often with simplified numerical examples or conceptual illustrations.

### 1. Recap: From RNNs/LSTMs to Transformers 🔄

**Goal:** Understand the limitations of previous sequence models that led to the development of Transformers.

* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) & LSTMs (Briefly):**
    * **Concept:** Process sequences one element at a time, maintaining a "hidden state."
    * **Limitations:**
        * **Sequential processing:** Slow for long sequences (cannot parallelize).
        * **Long-range dependencies:** Difficulty remembering information from far back in the sequence (vanishing/exploding gradients).
    * **Encoder-Decoder Architecture:** How RNNs were used for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., machine translation).

    **Example (Conceptual):**
    Imagine translating "The cat sat on the mat." An RNN processes "The", then "cat", then "sat", etc., passing information sequentially. If the sentence is very long, the initial information might get lost.

* **The Need for Parallelization & Better Long-Range Dependency Handling:**
    * Transformers were introduced to overcome these issues, allowing parallel processing and more direct access to distant information.

### 2. Attention Mechanism: The Core Innovation 💡

**Goal:** Understand the intuition and mechanics of Self-Attention and Multi-Head Attention.

* **Intuition of Attention:** "Pay attention to relevant parts of the input sequence when processing a specific part of the output sequence."
    * Think about how humans read: when translating a word, we look at other relevant words in the sentence.
* **Scaled Dot-Product Attention:**
    * **Queries (Q), Keys (K), Values (V):** These are linear transformations of the input embeddings.
        * **Query:** What I'm looking for.
        * **Key:** What I have.
        * **Value:** What I want to retrieve if the key matches the query.
    * **Mechanism:**
        1.  Calculate dot product of **Q** with all **K**s to get **scores** (how relevant each K is to Q).
        2.  **Scale** scores by $\sqrt{d_k}$ (where $d_k$ is dimension of K) to prevent large dot products from pushing softmax into regions with tiny gradients.
        3.  Apply **Softmax** to get **attention weights** (probabilities that sum to 1).
        4.  Multiply attention weights by **V**s and sum them up to get the **context vector** (weighted sum of Values).

    **Formula:** $Attention(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V$

    **Example (Simplified Numerics):**
    Let's say we have 3 words, each with a 2-dim embedding.
    $Q = \begin{pmatrix} 0.5 & 0.1 \end{pmatrix}$, $K = \begin{pmatrix} 0.8 & 0.2 \\ 0.3 & 0.7 \\ 0.9 & 0.1 \end{pmatrix}$, $V = \begin{pmatrix} 1.0 & 2.0 \\ 3.0 & 4.0 \\ 5.0 & 6.0 \end{pmatrix}$
    1.  $QK^T$: Compute dot products for $Q$ with each row of $K$.
    2.  Scale (e.g., by $\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414$).
    3.  Softmax: Get weights (e.g., $[0.2, 0.7, 0.1]$).
    4.  Weighted sum of $V$: $0.2 \cdot \text{row1}(V) + 0.7 \cdot \text{row2}(V) + 0.1 \cdot \text{row3}(V)$.

* **Multi-Head Attention:**
    * **Concept:** Instead of one attention computation, perform several in parallel ("heads") with different linear projections of Q, K, V.
    * **Benefit:** Allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions, capturing diverse relationships.
    * **Concatenation & Linear Projection:** Outputs of heads are concatenated and then projected back to original dimension.

### 3. Positional Encoding: Understanding Order 📍

**Goal:** Learn how Transformers incorporate sequence order information since attention is permutation-invariant.

* **The Problem:** Self-Attention itself does not inherently understand the order of words in a sequence. If you shuffle the input words, the attention output would be the same.
* **The Solution:** Add **Positional Encodings (PE)** to the input embeddings.
    * **Concept:** A vector that encodes the absolute or relative position of a token in the sequence.
    * **How it works:** PEs are added directly to the word embeddings at the input of the Encoder/Decoder.
    * **Types:** Often uses sine and cosine functions of different frequencies.
    * **Benefit:** Allows the model to learn that tokens at different positions have different meanings or relationships.

    **Example (Conceptual):**
    "I saw a bat flying." vs. "I saw a bat in the cave."
    Without positional encoding, "bat" might be treated the same. With PE, the model knows "bat" in position X and "bat" in position Y, allowing it to infer different meanings based on context (other words at specific positions).

    **Formula (Sine/Cosine):**
    $PE_{(pos, 2i)} = \sin(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{model}})$
    $PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} = \cos(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{model}})$
    where `pos` is the position, `i` is the dimension, and `d_model` is the embedding dimension.

### 4. Layer Normalization & Feed-Forward Networks 📈

**Goal:** Understand the roles of Layer Normalization and the position-wise Feed-Forward Network in a Transformer block.

* **Layer Normalization:**
    * **Concept:** Normalizes the inputs across the features (dimensions) for each sample independently.
    * **Contrast with Batch Normalization:** Batch Norm normalizes across the batch for each feature. Layer Norm is better for varying sequence lengths and smaller batch sizes.
    * **Benefit:** Stabilizes training, makes it faster, and helps with deeper networks by preventing activations from growing too large or too small.
    * **Placement:** Applied before or after the sub-layers (Attention, FFN) and followed by a residual connection.

    **Example (Conceptual):**
    Imagine a layer outputting `[100, 2, 500]`. After Layer Normalization, it might become `[-1.0, -1.2, 1.3]`, with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, making it easier for the next layer to process.

* **Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks (FFN):**
    * **Concept:** A simple two-layer fully connected neural network applied independently to each position (token) in the sequence.
    * **Architecture:** `Linear -> ReLU -> Linear`
    * **Benefit:** Allows the Transformer to introduce non-linearity and process each token's representation further after the Attention mechanism, acting as a "feature extractor" for each position. It's the same FFN applied to every position, but with different inputs at each position.

### 5. Transformer Encoder-Decoder Architecture 🏗️

**Goal:** Integrate all components to understand the full Transformer architecture.

* **Encoder Block:**
    * Input: Embeddings + Positional Encodings.
    * Consists of: **Multi-Head Self-Attention** -> **Add & Norm** -> **Feed-Forward Network** -> **Add & Norm**.
    * Stacks multiple Encoder blocks.
* **Decoder Block:**
    * Input: Embeddings + Positional Encodings (of target sequence) + Encoder output.
    * Consists of:
        1.  **Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention:** Prevents attending to future tokens in the output sequence during training.
        2.  **Add & Norm.**
        3.  **Multi-Head Encoder-Decoder Attention:** Attends to the output of the Encoder stack (Q from Decoder, K/V from Encoder).
        4.  **Add & Norm.**
        5.  **Feed-Forward Network.**
        6.  **Add & Norm.**
    * Stacks multiple Decoder blocks.
* **Training & Inference:** How the Encoder and Decoder work together for tasks like machine translation.
