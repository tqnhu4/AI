# Build a Daily Task Scheduler with Amazon PartyRock

---

## 1.1 Project Overview üéØ

Our goal is to create a simple, interactive **Daily Task Scheduler** application. This app will allow you to:

* Input your daily tasks.
* Get suggestions or organization for these tasks.
* Potentially mark tasks as complete or rearrange them (though the core functionality will depend on PartyRock's generative capabilities).

This project demonstrates how generative AI can be used to quickly prototype and build functional applications, showcasing your understanding of AI integration and product thinking.

## 1.2 Getting Started with PartyRock üöÄ

First, you need to access the Amazon PartyRock platform.

1.  **Navigate to PartyRock:** Open your web browser and go to `https://partyrock.aws/`.
2.  **Sign In/Create Account:** You'll likely be prompted to sign in with your AWS account or create a new one. Follow the on-screen instructions.
3.  **Launch PartyRock:** Once signed in, you should see the PartyRock dashboard. You can start a new project by clicking "Build your own app" or similar.

## 1.3.1 Generating the Daily Task Scheduler Application ü§ñ

PartyRock uses an LLM to generate application widgets based on your prompts. The quality of your prompt is crucial!

1.  **Start a New App:** On the PartyRock homepage, click "Build your own app" or "Start from scratch." or "Generate app"
2.  **Initial Prompt:** You'll see a text box where you can describe the application you want to build. For our daily task scheduler, use a detailed prompt.

    **Recommended Prompt:**

    ```
    "Build a daily task scheduler application. It should have a text input field where I can list my tasks for the day, each on a new line. Then, it should have a section that neatly organizes these tasks, perhaps categorizing them by priority (High, Medium, Low) or time (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) and presenting them as a clear, actionable list. Include a title for the application."
    ```

3.  **Generate:** Click the "Generate" button (or similar) to let PartyRock create the initial widgets for your application. This might take a few moments.

    * **Expected Output:** PartyRock should generate at least two main widgets:
        * A **text input** widget for you to type your tasks.
        * A **text output** widget that will process and display the organized tasks.
        * Possibly a **title** widget.

## 1.3.2 Modify Existing Widgets ‚úèÔ∏è

Once the initial application is generated, you can refine its components.

1.  **Edit the Input Widget:**
    * Click on the text input widget.
    * Change its title to "Your Daily Tasks" or "Enter Tasks Here".
    * You might want to add a placeholder text like "e.g., Buy groceries, Finish report, Call client" to guide the user.
2.  **Edit the Output Widget (Task Organizer):**
    * Click on the text output widget that organizes tasks.
    * **Crucially, modify its prompt** to control how it processes the input.
    * **Original Prompt (likely):** Might be something generic like "Organize the following text."
    * **Improved Prompt:**

        ```
        "Organize the following tasks from the input field into a prioritized list (High, Medium, Low). For each task, suggest a short, actionable verb. Format:
        ### High Priority
        - [ ] Task 1 (e.g., "Complete X")
        - [ ] Task 2
        ### Medium Priority
        - [ ] Task 3
        ### Low Priority
        - [ ] Task 4

        Input: {{Your Input Widget Name.output}}"
        ```

        * **`{{Your Input Widget Name.output}}`**: This is how you reference the output of another widget in PartyRock. Replace "Your Input Widget Name" with the actual name of your input widget (e.g., `text_input_1`) or input "@" to make PartyRock show a list to select. PartyRock usually provides an autocomplete helper for this.
    * **Regenerate:** After modifying the prompt, the output widget should regenerate its content based on the new instructions.

---

## 1.3.3 Add New Widgets ‚ûï

Let's enhance the application with more features.

1.  **Add a "Clear All" Button (Optional, if PartyRock supports buttons):**
    * Look for an "Add Widget" or "+" button.
    * If there's a "Button" widget, add it.
    * Configure it to clear the input field (PartyRock's specific mechanism for this might vary, you might need to prompt it for "reset functionality").
2.  **Add a "Motivational Quote" Widget (Text Output):**
    * Add another "Text Output" widget.
    * **Prompt for this widget:**

        ```
        "Generate a short, encouraging motivational quote for productivity. Avoid clich√©s."
        ```

    * This widget will provide a fresh quote each time the app is interacted with.
3.  **Add a "Time Estimator" Widget (Text Output):**
    * Add another "Text Output" widget.
    * **Prompt for this widget:**

        ```
        "Given the following list of tasks from the input field, provide a rough time estimate in minutes for each task. Then, calculate the total estimated time for all tasks.

        Input: {{Your Input Widget Name.output}}"
        ```

    * This will add practical value to your scheduler.

## 1.3.4 Publish Your Application (at the top)üåê

Once you are satisfied with your application, you can publish it to share with others.

1.  **Locate the Publish Button:** Look for a "Publish" button, usually at the top right corner of the PartyRock interface.
2.  **Review & Confirm:** PartyRock might ask you to confirm details or give your app a final name.
3.  **Share Link:** After publishing, you'll get a shareable URL that you can send to anyone to try out your daily task scheduler!

## 1.4 Importance of a Detailed Prompt üìù

As you've seen, the prompt you provide to PartyRock's LLM is paramount. A detailed and well-structured prompt helps the AI understand your intentions precisely.

* **Be Specific:** Instead of "Make a task app," say "Build a daily task scheduler with an input field for tasks and an organized output."
* **Define Output Format:** Specify how you want the output to be formatted (e.g., "prioritized list," "each on a new line," "use checkboxes").
* **Reference Inputs:** Clearly indicate which inputs the output widget should process (e.g., `{{input_widget.output}}`).
* **Iterate:** It's rare to get the perfect app on the first try. Experiment with different prompts and modify existing widgets' prompts to fine-tune the behavior.

## 1.5 Conclusion & Clean-up ‚úÖ

Congratulations! You've successfully built a daily task scheduler using Amazon PartyRock. This project highlights the power of generative AI in quickly bringing ideas to life.

**To clean up (if you wish to remove your app):**

* Go back to your PartyRock dashboard.
* Find your application.
* There should be an option to "Delete" or "Archive" the application. Follow the prompts to remove it.

This experience should give you a solid understanding of leveraging generative AI platforms for rapid application development. Feel free to experiment with different types of applications and prompts within PartyRock!
