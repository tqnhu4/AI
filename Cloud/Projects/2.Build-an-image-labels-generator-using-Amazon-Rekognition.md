## üöÄ 2.1 Project Overview

In this project, you'll create a Python script that automatically generates labels for images stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. We'll leverage **Amazon Rekognition** for its powerful image analysis capabilities. The process will involve:

1.  Uploading your images to an **Amazon S3 bucket**.
2.  Setting up your local environment with the **AWS CLI** and necessary Python libraries.
3.  Writing Python code to interact with S3 and Rekognition.
4.  Executing your script to get the labels.

-----

## ‚òÅÔ∏è 2.2.1 Create S3 bucket and upload images

First, you need a place to store your images. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is perfect for this.

1.  **Sign in to the AWS Management Console:** Go to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and sign in.
2.  **Navigate to S3:** In the search bar at the top, type "S3" and select "S3" from the services.
3.  **Create a bucket:**
      * Click on the "Create bucket" button.
      * **Bucket name:** Choose a unique, DNS-compliant name (e.g., `my-rekognition-images-generator`). Make sure it's globally unique.
      * **AWS Region:** Select a region close to you or where you intend to run your Rekognition service (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`).
      * You can leave other settings as default for this project, but for production, consider block public access settings. For now, ensure your bucket allows public access if you plan to access images directly via URL (though our script will use AWS credentials, so this isn't strictly necessary for the script itself).
      * Click "Create bucket."
4.  **Upload your images:**
      * Once the bucket is created, click on its name to enter it.
      * Click the "Upload" button.
      * Drag and drop the images you want to analyze into the upload area, or click "Add files" to select them.
      * Click "Upload" to complete the process.

## üñ•Ô∏è 2.2.2 Install and configure AWS CLI

The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. It's essential for configuring your credentials locally, which your Python script will use.

1.  **Install AWS CLI:**
      * **Windows:** Download the MSI installer from the [AWS CLI documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-windows.html).
      * **macOS/Linux:** Use `pip` (ensure Python and pip are installed):
        ```bash
        pip install awscli
        ```
        Or, use the OS-specific package manager if preferred (refer to the [AWS CLI documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-linux.html)).
      * Verify installation:
        ```bash
        aws --version
        ```
2.  **Configure AWS CLI:**
      * Run the configuration command:
        ```bash
        aws configure
        ```
      * You'll be prompted for:
          * **AWS Access Key ID:** You can create a new Access Key ID and Secret Access Key from the AWS Management Console under "My security credentials" for an IAM user. **Best practice:** Create a dedicated IAM user with limited permissions (specifically, `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` for the S3 bucket and `AmazonRekognitionReadOnlyAccess`) rather than using your root account credentials.
          * **AWS Secret Access Key:** The secret key associated with your Access Key ID.
          * **Default region name:** Use the same region you chose for your S3 bucket (e.g., `us-east-1`).
          * **Default output format:** You can press Enter for `json` (default).

## üêç 2.2.3 Import Libraries

Now, let's set up your Python environment. You'll need `boto3`, the AWS SDK for Python, to interact with AWS services.

1.  **Create a project directory:**
    ```bash
    mkdir rekognition-label-generator
    cd rekognition-label-generator
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
      * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
      * **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
4.  **Install `boto3`:**
    ```bash
    pip install boto3
    ```
5.  **Create your Python script:** Create a file named `rekognition_labels.py` (or any other name you prefer) in your project directory.

Now, open `rekognition_labels.py` and start by importing the necessary libraries:

```python
import boto3
import os
```

-----

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2.2.4 Define Functions

Let's define the core functions for our script. We'll need functions to list images from S3 and to detect labels using Rekognition.

```python
# Initialize S3 and Rekognition clients
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
rekognition = boto3.client('rekognition', region_name='YOUR_AWS_REGION') # Replace YOUR_AWS_REGION

def list_s3_images(bucket_name):
    """
    Lists all image files in the specified S3 bucket.
    """
    print(f"Listing images in S3 bucket: {bucket_name}...")
    images = []
    try:
        response = s3.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name)
        if 'Contents' in response:
            for obj in response['Contents']:
                # Filter for common image file extensions
                if obj['Key'].lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif', '.bmp', '.tiff')):
                    images.append(obj['Key'])
        print(f"Found {len(images)} images.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error listing images from S3: {e}")
    return images

def detect_image_labels(bucket_name, image_key):
    """
    Detects labels in an image stored in S3 using Amazon Rekognition.
    """
    print(f"Detecting labels for {image_key}...")
    try:
        response = rekognition.detect_labels(
            Image={
                'S3Object': {
                    'Bucket': bucket_name,
                    'Name': image_key
                }
            },
            MaxLabels=10, # Maximum number of labels to return
            MinConfidence=70 # Minimum confidence level for labels
        )
        labels = []
        for label in response['Labels']:
            labels.append(f"{label['Name']} (Confidence: {label['Confidence']:.2f}%)")
        print(f"  Labels found: {', '.join(labels) if labels else 'None'}")
        return labels
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error detecting labels for {image_key}: {e}")
        return []
```

**Remember to replace `YOUR_AWS_REGION` with the actual AWS region of your S3 bucket (e.g., `'us-east-1'`).**

-----

## üìù 2.2.5 Final Code

Now, let's put it all together in your `rekognition_labels.py` file.

```python
import boto3
import os

# --- Configuration ---
# Replace with your S3 bucket name
S3_BUCKET_NAME = 'my-rekognition-images-generator'
# Replace with the AWS region where your S3 bucket and Rekognition are located
AWS_REGION = 'us-east-1' 

# --- Initialize Clients ---
s3 = boto3.client('s3')
rekognition = boto3.client('rekognition', region_name=AWS_REGION)

# --- Functions (as defined in 2.2D) ---
def list_s3_images(bucket_name):
    """
    Lists all image files in the specified S3 bucket.
    """
    print(f"Listing images in S3 bucket: {bucket_name}...")
    images = []
    try:
        response = s3.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name)
        if 'Contents' in response:
            for obj in response['Contents']:
                # Filter for common image file extensions
                if obj['Key'].lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif', '.bmp', '.tiff')):
                    images.append(obj['Key'])
        print(f"Found {len(images)} images.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error listing images from S3: {e}")
    return images

def detect_image_labels(bucket_name, image_key):
    """
    Detects labels in an image stored in S3 using Amazon Rekognition.
    """
    print(f"Detecting labels for {image_key}...")
    try:
        response = rekognition.detect_labels(
            Image={
                'S3Object': {
                    'Bucket': bucket_name,
                    'Name': image_key
                }
            },
            MaxLabels=10, # Maximum number of labels to return
            MinConfidence=70 # Minimum confidence level for labels
        )
        labels = []
        for label in response['Labels']:
            labels.append(f"{label['Name']} (Confidence: {label['Confidence']:.2f}%)")
        print(f"  Labels found: {', '.join(labels) if labels else 'None'}")
        return labels
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error detecting labels for {image_key}: {e}")
        return []

# --- Main Execution ---
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Starting Amazon Rekognition Image Label Generator...")
    
    # List images in the S3 bucket
    image_keys = list_s3_images(S3_BUCKET_NAME)

    if image_keys:
        # Process each image
        for image_key in image_keys:
            labels = detect_image_labels(S3_BUCKET_NAME, image_key)
            # You can store these labels in a database, write to a file, etc.
            # For this example, we just print them to the console.
    else:
        print("No images found in the specified S3 bucket. Please upload images to continue.")

    print("\nProject execution complete.")
```

**Important:** Make sure you replace `my-rekognition-images-generator` with the actual name of your S3 bucket and `us-east-1` with your chosen AWS region.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 2.2.6 Running your Project

With your `rekognition_labels.py` file complete, you're ready to run your label generator\!

1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**
2.  **Navigate to your project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd rekognition-label-generator
    ```
3.  **Activate your virtual environment (if you created one):**
      * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
      * **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
4.  **Run the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python rekognition_labels.py
    ```

You should see output in your terminal indicating that the script is listing images from your S3 bucket and then printing the detected labels for each image, along with their confidence scores.

## ‚úÖ 2.3 Conclusion & Clean-up

**Conclusion:**
You've successfully built an image label generator using Amazon Rekognition\! This project demonstrated how to:

  * Store images in **Amazon S3**.
  * Configure the **AWS CLI** for credential management.
  * Use the **`boto3`** library to interact with AWS services.
  * Leverage **Amazon Rekognition's `detect_labels`** functionality to automatically analyze images.

This is a foundational project. You could extend it by:

  * Storing labels in a database (like DynamoDB).
  * Creating a web interface to upload images and view labels.
  * Triggering the label generation automatically when new images are uploaded to S3 using AWS Lambda.

-----

**Clean-up:**
To avoid incurring unnecessary AWS charges, it's a good practice to clean up the resources you've created.

1.  **Empty and Delete S3 Bucket:**
      * Go to the S3 console.
      * Click on your bucket (`my-rekognition-images-generator`).
      * Click "Empty" and confirm by typing "permanently delete".
      * After emptying, click "Delete" and confirm the bucket name.
2.  **Delete IAM User/Access Keys (Optional but Recommended):**
      * If you created a specific IAM user for this project, go to the IAM console.
      * Navigate to "Users," select the user, and delete them. This will also remove the associated access keys.
      * If you only created access keys for an existing user, go to "Security credentials" for that user and delete the access keys.

By following these steps, you've completed your Amazon Rekognition image label generator project\!
