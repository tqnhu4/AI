# ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Extract structured data from a CSV or JSON file using Amazon Bedrock and process the content through an FM (e.g. Claude or Titan).

## ðŸªœ Steps to follow

## âœ… Step 1: Prepare data

- Create a .csv or .json file for example:
```csv
Name,Age,Role
Alice,30,Developer
Bob,25,Designer

```

```json
[
  { "name": "Alice", "age": 30, "role": "Developer" },
  { "name": "Bob", "age": 25, "role": "Designer" }
]

```

## âœ… Step 2: Create a prompt to "understand" the data
You need to create prompts to help FM understand and process the data. For example:

```text
Here is a CSV file content:
Name,Age,Role
Alice,30,Developer
Bob,25,Designer

Extract each row into JSON object format.
```

Or if it's JSON:

```text
Here is a JSON list of people. Summarize the number of developers and list their names.

[
  { "name": "Alice", "age": 30, "role": "Developer" },
  { "name": "Bob", "age": 25, "role": "Designer" }
]
```
## âœ… Step 3: Go to Amazon Bedrock
- Log in to AWS Console

- Go to: Amazon Bedrock

- Go to the Playground tab > Chat / Text

## âœ… Step 4: Choose a platform model

- Select a model like Anthropic Claude, AI21 Jurassic, or Amazon Titan
  - Mode: Single prompt
  - Select model: 
    - 1.Categories > Amazon
    - 2.Models: 
      - If empty then "Request access", select model and click on "Available to request" then "Request model access"
      - Else select Model > Apply 

- Paste the prompt into the input box

- Press Submit to see the results

## âœ… Step 5: Results

- Output of csv:
  - Here is the updated CSV file:

```tabular-data-csv
Name,Age,Role
Alice,30,Developer
Bob,25,Designer
```

  - Here is the updated JSON file:

```tabular-data-json
{
    "rows": [
        {
            "Name": "Alice",
            "Age": "30",
            "Role": "Developer"
        },
        {
            "Name": "Bob",
            "Age": "25",
            "Role": "Designer"
        }
    ]
}
```

- Output of json:
  - Here is a summary of the number of developers and their names:
```text
    Alice, 30 years old, is a developer.
    Bob, 25 years old, is a designer.
```
