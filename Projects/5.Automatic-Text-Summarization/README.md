### üöÄ Development Steps & Code Snippets

#### 1\. Project Setup & Environment Configuration

First, create a new directory for your project and set up a virtual environment.

```bash
mkdir text_summarizer_app
cd text_summarizer_app
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

Next, install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install streamlit transformers torch PyPDF2
```

**Note:** `torch` (PyTorch) is a dependency for Hugging Face Transformers. If you face installation issues, refer to the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for specific installation instructions based on your system (especially if you have a GPU). For CPU-only, `pip install torch` usually works.

#### 2\. Create the Streamlit Application File

Create a file named `app.py` in your project directory. This will contain all the Streamlit UI and backend logic for this MVP.

#### 3\. Implement Core Summarization Logic

Inside `app.py`, let's define the summarization function using Hugging Face's `pipeline`.

```python
# app.py

import streamlit as st
from transformers import pipeline
import PyPDF2
import io

# Initialize the summarization pipeline
# Using 'sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6' which is a good general-purpose summarization model.
# This will download the model the first time it runs.
@st.cache_resource
def load_summarizer():
    return pipeline("summarization", model="sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6")

summarizer = load_summarizer()

def summarize_text(text, max_length=150, min_length=30):
    if not text.strip():
        return "No text provided to summarize."
    try:
        # The summarizer often takes a list of texts
        summary = summarizer(text, max_length=max_length, min_length=min_length, do_sample=False)
        return summary[0]['summary_text']
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error during summarization: {e}"

def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_file):
    text = ""
    try:
        # PyPDF2 expects a binary file, so use io.BytesIO for uploaded files
        pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(io.BytesIO(pdf_file.read()))
        for page_num in range(len(pdf_reader.pages)):
            page = pdf_reader.pages[page_num]
            text += page.extract_text()
        return text
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error extracting text from PDF: {e}"

```

**Explanation:**

  * `@st.cache_resource`: This decorator tells Streamlit to cache the summarizer model. This means the model will only be downloaded and loaded into memory once, significantly speeding up subsequent runs of the application.
  * `pipeline("summarization", model="sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6")`: This is the magic line from Hugging Face. It sets up a pre-trained model for summarization. The chosen model is `distilbart-cnn-12-6`, which is a good balance between performance and size for general text summarization.
  * `summarize_text`: This function takes the text and optional `max_length`/`min_length` for the summary. It handles potential empty input.
  * `extract_text_from_pdf`: This function uses `PyPDF2` to read a PDF file object (from Streamlit's `st.file_uploader`) and extract all text from its pages.

#### 4\. Build the Streamlit User Interface

Now, let's add the UI elements to `app.py`.

```python
# app.py (continued)

st.set_page_config(page_title="AI Text Summarizer", layout="wide")

st.title("üß† AI Text Summarizer")
st.markdown("---")

st.subheader("1. Summarize from Text Input")
text_input = st.text_area("Paste your text here:", height=300, help="Enter the long text you want to summarize.")

if st.button("Summarize Text"):
    if text_input:
        with st.spinner("Summarizing... Please wait."):
            summary = summarize_text(text_input)
            st.success("Summary from Text:")
            st.write(summary)
    else:
        st.warning("Please paste some text to summarize.")

st.markdown("---")

st.subheader("2. Summarize from PDF Upload")
pdf_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a PDF file:", type=["pdf"], help="Upload a PDF document to get its summary.")

if pdf_file:
    with st.spinner("Extracting text from PDF and summarizing..."):
        extracted_text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_file)
        if "Error" in extracted_text:
            st.error(extracted_text) # Display PDF extraction error
        elif extracted_text.strip():
            summary = summarize_text(extracted_text)
            st.success("Summary from PDF:")
            st.write(summary)
            # Optionally show extracted text for debugging/transparency
            # with st.expander("View Extracted Text from PDF"):
            #     st.text(extracted_text[:1000] + "..." if len(extracted_text) > 1000 else extracted_text)
        else:
            st.warning("Could not extract any meaningful text from the PDF.")
else:
    st.info("Upload a PDF file above to get its summary.")

st.markdown("---")
st.caption("Powered by Hugging Face Transformers & Streamlit")

```

**Explanation:**

  * `st.set_page_config`: Configures the browser tab title and page layout.
  * `st.title`, `st.subheader`, `st.markdown`: Used for structuring the content with titles and separators.
  * `st.text_area`: Provides a multi-line input box for users to paste text.
  * `st.button`: Triggers the summarization process for text input.
  * `st.file_uploader`: Allows users to upload PDF files.
  * `st.spinner`: Shows a loading indicator while the summarization is in progress.
  * `st.success`, `st.warning`, `st.error`, `st.info`: Display various types of messages to the user.
  * `st.write`: Displays the resulting summary.

#### 5\. Run the Application

Save the `app.py` file. Then, open your terminal (make sure your virtual environment is activated) and run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This command will open a new tab in your web browser, pointing to your Streamlit application. The first time you run it, it will download the `distilbart-cnn-12-6` model, which might take a few minutes depending on your internet connection.
